# Telecom-Customers-Churn-Prediction-Using-Different-Machine-Learning-Algos

We are going to focus on the following objectives:

1. Understand the business case study

2. Import key Python libraries, dataset, and perform Exploratory Data Analysis

3. Perform interactive data visualization using Seaborn and Plotly

4. Prepare the data to increase the predictive power of Machine Learning models by Feature dropping, plotting Feature importance, and Train/Test Split

5. Build and train Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naive Bayes Classifier models to predict the churning of Telecom customers

6. Calculate AUC score and ROC curve from the trained models
